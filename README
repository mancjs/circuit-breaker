Introduction

This repo is a bare-bones version of a broker.
Your broker must be deployed to a public URL on Heroku.

Prerequisites

1. Heroku account (see below)
2. node + npm
3. git

Deploying to Heroku

1. Create an account at https://www.heroku.com
2. Follow the setup instructions here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up
3. On the command line, run `herkou create`.
4. Deploy by pushing to the heroku remote (created by the command above), i.e. `git push heroku master`.
5. Your public URL will be output to the command line after the push.

Structure

server.js is a simple Express API. It contains two functions, `initialiseMines` which creates the list
of Mine objects representing the server endpoints, and `listMines` which queries the mines passed to it
in parallel to fetch the complete list of resources, or an error if *any* of them fail.

circuit-breaker.js and mine.js are the current default implementations.
